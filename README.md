Hypothetical Relational Data for a Retail Company

# Business Understanding
Your client, a company in retail, asks for your help in establishing a relational database that will allow them for an in-depth analysis.
Currently, data is stored in different applications and they wish that it would be unified using the relational database. The data includes
records on their products, orders made, customer profile, and the different suppliers providing the items. As the way things go in the business, 
a supplier may supply not just one but also many items, a customer may purchase more than one item, a product may be ordered by many customers, and
each order is delivered by one rider.
