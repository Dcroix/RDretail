Hypothetical Relational Data for a Retail Company

# Business Understanding
Your client, a company in retail, asks for your help in establishing a relational database that will allow them for an in-depth analysis.
Currently, data is stored in different applications and they wish that it would be unified using the relational database. The data includes
records on their products, orders made, customer profile, and the different suppliers providing the items. As the way things go in the business, 
a supplier may supply not just one but also many items, a customer may purchase more than one item, a product may be ordered by many customers, and
each order is delivered by one rider. 

# Your Task for Day One
1. Create an Entity Relationship Diagram presenting multiciplity using the UML notation
2. Design the Database Schema presenting the relationship of entities and multiplicity using the UML notation.

# Options
In designing your ER Diagram and DB Schema, you may want to use Draw.io using this [link](https://app.diagrams.net/) or
you can also design via Powerpoint.

# Your Task for Day Two
1. Import the datasets included in this repository into MySQL; have them imported as one table each.
2. For each table, make sure you have Primary Keys and Constraints (an important one is that NULL is not allowed)
3. Establish the relationship of each table using foreign keys. Make use of the Database Schema you have created during Day One.
4. Save a copy of the Database Schema presented in the PHP MyAdmin MySQL platform.
